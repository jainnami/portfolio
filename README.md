# Hi there, I'm Nami! 👋

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a Master’s student in **Data Science** at **Columbia University**, and I recently graduated **summa cum laude** from **Virginia Tech** with a B.S. in **Computational Modeling & Data Analytics** and a minor in **Smart & Sustainable Cities**. I’m passionate about using machine learning, AI, and cloud technologies to solve real-world challenges in infrastructure, sustainability, and public health.
